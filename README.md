The entire system can be divided into systems running in visual studios and systems running in Arduino.

The two systems are connected by serial communication. 

When the visual studio recognizes the vehicle entering the parking lot, enter "1" in the Arduino as a serial communication.

If arduino received "1" from visual studio, turn on the guideLEDs for users.
